# AED withdrawal relapse risk calculator

This page contains an Excel tool to aid in the decision to withdraw anti-epileptic 
drugs. The tool predicts the risk of seizure recurrence at two and five years,
and the chance of being seizure-free at ten years after starting anti-epileptic
drug withdrawal. 
The tool is also available as web-based application at http://epilepsypredictiontools.info

The tool is an adaptation of two nomograms. The development and validation of these nomograms is described in the following publication: 
Lamberink HJ, Otte WM, Geerts AT, Pavlovic M, Ramos-Lizana J, Marson AG, Overweg J, Sauma L, Specchio LM, Tennison M, Cardoso TMO, Shinnar  S, Schmidt D, Geleijns K, Braun KPJ.

Lancet Neurology 2017; published online May 5, 2017: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(17)30114-X
